# Design principles

While it may not be apparent from the code, there are a few key principles behind the visual design of these tools.

**1. Time-to-results.** The tools are designed to support discussions, perhaps even spawn a few. As people are typing their arguments furiously, they may use these tools to magically summon numbers (that nobody verifies anyway) as if it means something. Users are mostly interested in the results to win the argument and not marvel at the power of the tool. It should be the tool's focus to get results with just a few clicks.


**2. Broad analysis vs average values**
Too many keyboard warriors use average values in their arguments. However convenient they may be, averages don't capture the behaviour or reliability of some game mechanics, such as a unit's performance in combat. In Warhammer terms, how reliable is an average value of 2 kills when it charges into a unit? How big is the risk of failing? Average values do not desribe this, yet that may prove whether or not an action is safe to execute. But a broad analysis may require more complex math. These tools aim to tackle the maths for the users, so that they get more information for the same (or less) effort.

**3. Linking to results**
In a world where everything can be shared, it seemed silly not to allow a user to share a page or result. Especially, if this link preserves their settings and parameters, it may ease the barrier of entry for users to follow someone's link to their calculations.

**4. Hot-link for images** 
When the results matter, then these results should be easy to link in a discussion. Users are unlikely to bother with taking a screenshot, uploading it on some obscure website and then copy-pasting the url in their discussion. Hot-linking for the win.

**5. Mobility.**
While the complexity of the form may hamper ease of use on a small screen, the tools are designed mobile-first. This tends to lead to more elegant designs. I delude myself, thinking that users will find joy in theorizing about units on the bus, train or the small room they take their cellphone to.


**6. Ease of use**
The simplicity of the interface may belie the effort put into it. It's the result of a lot of thought and a few years of experience in building such tools (and failing ;)). It's not perfect.. but then I'm still learning as I go.
